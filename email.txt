Write a program to

A. Download the sequence record with the ID number
FJ966082 and print it out. What kind of a sequence
is this?
B. Print out the comments section of the annotation
C. Translate the DNA sequence into a protein
sequence and print it out
D. Print the downloaded seq in FASTA format
E. Write a function that takes a sequence record as
input and prints it out in FASTA format
